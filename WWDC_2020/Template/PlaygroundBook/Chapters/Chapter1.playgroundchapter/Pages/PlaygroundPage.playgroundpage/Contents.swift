 # Welcome!
First I would like you to take a little __test__.
 
The test consists of selecting the correct words to complete the sentences, within the established time limit. Click on the red spaces to select the word you want to complete.
 When you get all the words right, you can go to the next step by clicking the "next" button.

 Get as many __words__ as possible, because your score is based on the performance between the number of words
 correct and the time used. But, be careful, when you miss a word you also __lose__ points, so don't try to get
 lucky.

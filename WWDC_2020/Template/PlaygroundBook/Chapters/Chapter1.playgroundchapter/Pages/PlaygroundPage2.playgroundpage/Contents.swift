 I'm sure you felt a lot of difficulty in the __third__ sentence, right? The difficulty you felt, is exactly the
 same as about __17%__ of the world population, more than 1 billion people, can feel daily, that they are the
 people who have dyslexia.
 
 ## What is Dyslexia?
 __Dyslexia__ is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds
 and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called reading disability, dyslexia affects
 areas of the brain that process language.
 
 ## Empathy and Dyslexia
 I could have started this project by explaining dyslexia and all of its theory, however, it would probably be
 just another topic that we have mastered the theory and are totally out of practice.
 
 In the words of a dyslexic: "Most authors and books dealing with the subject speak of dyslexics in a
 very" labeling "way, as a result, people end up trapping themselves in a very simplistic definition,
 something like" someone who inverts letters or has reading problems ". " Ponce, Felipe _ DislexClub.
 
 So, in an attempt to escape this usual way of talking about
 dyslexia, I decided to use another method to help us understand the reality not only of dyslexia, but of any
 other problem. This method is called __EMPATHY__.

 ## But what is empathy?
 __Empathy__ is nothing more than putting yourself in the other's place, so that we can understand your point of
 view and, consequently, understand the difficulties. And as you have experienced, it is very important to know the
 theory, but we only really understand the reality of the problem when we put ourselves in the shoes of those who
 face it.

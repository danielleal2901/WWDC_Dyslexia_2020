 ## Quotes
 
 __Author: Steve Jobs__
 
 “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to
 lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
 
 “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s
 worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
 
 “If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you
 find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.”
